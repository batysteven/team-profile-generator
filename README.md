## Description
With the team-profile-generator program the user is able to generate a team consisting of one manager, and any number of engineer's and intern's. Using npm package inquirer, the user will fill in prompts about the user first. User's name, github, and email. Afterwards the user will be prompted to fill in the manager's info. This info will be manager's name, id, email address, and office number. Next the user will be prompted to add an engineer, intern, or finished. If selected engineer, the user will be prompted for engineer's name, id, email address, and github username. If selected intern, the user will be prompted for intern's name, email address, and school. When the user is done adding engineer's and intern's, the user will select finished. There will be an index.html page then loaded into the dist folder for the user.
